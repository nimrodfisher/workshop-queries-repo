data_quality_notes:
  - |
    EMPTY FIELDS ARE NOT NECESSARILY DATA QUALITY ISSUES
    Example: null total_videousers when team didn't publish video
    This indicates missing activity, not missing data
    
  - |
    ADOPTION METRICS
    Some metrics track optional features (automation, advanced clipping tools)
    Low adoption doesn't indicate data quality issue
    Instead indicates feature adoption phase or feature requests
    
  - |
    MULTI-LANGUAGE COMPLEXITY
    Each team appears multiple times per reporting period (different languages)
    This is intentional market segmentation
    Not data duplication - track separately for market insights

recommendations:
  - |
    Track Automation Metrics
    Monitor adoption_percentage to understand transition to automated tools
    This metric should be captured for all content creation events
    
  - |
    Monitor Tool Adoption Over Time
    Compare usage rates of manual vs semi-automated vs fully automated tools
    Track adoption curve to understand tool effectiveness
    
  - |
